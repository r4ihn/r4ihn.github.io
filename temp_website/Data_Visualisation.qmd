# My data visualisation work
In Polytechnic, I studied Aerospace Engineering where I had to be proficient in calculating Thermodynamics and using computer software to design and test aircraft parts for their aerodynamic properties. One of the softwares that I used was CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software which would simulate airflow over a 3D model of an aircraft part. The software would then generate data which I would then have to visualise using graphs and charts to present my findings.

## Here are some examples of my data visualisation work
Shown below is a velocity vector plot that would showcase the turbulence and the flow of air over an balloon shape.
