# About me

Hi! My name is Raihan, I am currently a student in Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) pursuing a Bachelor (Hons) in Applied Computing with a specialisation in Financial Technology.

## My hobbies

In my free time, I like to ride my road bike (which is a Seka Exceed RDC by the way!) and also taking care of my cat named Jebat Tobby (short for Toblerone). <br>

I also like to spend my time doing personal projects to up skill myself in the world of technology by programming and adding it to a repository on [Github](https://github.com/r4ihn)!<br>
