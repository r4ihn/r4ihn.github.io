# My data visualisation work
In Polytechnic, I studied Aerospace Engineering where I had to be proficient in calculating Thermodynamics and using computer software to design and test aircraft parts for their aerodynamic properties. One of the softwares that I used was CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software which would simulate airflow over a 3D model of an aircraft part. The software would then generate data which I would then have to visualise using graphs and charts to present my findings.

## Here are some examples of my data visualisation work
Shown below is a velocity vector plot that would showcase the turbulence and the flow of air over an balloon shape.

The tiny black arrows represent the direction of the airflow. You can see them splitting around the nose and smoothly rejoining at the tail.

At the entrance of the teardrop shape, the flow of wind is blue which is slower. As it passes over the wing/constriction, it turns green which means that the air is moving faster due to the Venturi effect.

The blue colour at the nose
