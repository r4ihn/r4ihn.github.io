# What did I do for my FYP?

For my Final Year Project (FYP), I was tasked to create a miniature version of the B747-400 Krueger and Fowler flaps systems inclusive of the cockpit mechanism to control the flaps. Additionally, I also created a working power supply system to power the entire setup. <br>

# How did I do it?

As I was attached to Lufthansa Technik, I had instructors who were previously Aircraft Maintainence Engineers (LAME) whom would assist me whenever I had trouble. I had to plan the wiring, the schematics for mechanical parts and how to build them to specification. <br>

# What did I learn?

I learnt to be more patient and detail-oriented as I had to ensure that every part was built to specification and that the wiring was done correctly to avoid any short circuits. I also learnt how to use various tools and software such as CAD software for designing parts and simulation software for testing the electrical systems. <br>
